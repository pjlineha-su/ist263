        <h2>Smile! You're in Fes</h2>
        <p>By Patrick Linehan</p>

        <p>
            A labyrinth of alley ways weave through Fes’s old medina. It is the largest vehicle free zone in any urban area in the world: 14 square kilometers. Google maps doesn’t work. Street signs are either non-existent or contradicting<span id="dots">...</span>  
        </p>
        <div id="more">
        <p>
            Caitlin and I first made our way into this maze around 3 pm, wandering down a busy street lined with shops and schools and homes. We took a right turn out of intuition and were suddenly walking into an increasingly narrower and darker passage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tourists with their Nikon cameras and Birkenstock sandals were nowhere to be seen. The friendly smiles of shopkeepers turned into scowls of 20-somethings hanging out at the intersections. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking advantage of our geographic unawareness, they would yell out to us. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “No not that way. That’s the wrong way. Tannery’s this way! Only Muslims can go there.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing that faux guides try to swindle money from tourists, we ignored them with a smile. We wandered deeper as the sun lowered in the sky. As the city got darker, we realized we were very lost, increasingly nervous, and claustrophobic. We could only see a slice of the gray sky directly above us. My heart rate ticked up as more and more faux guides tried to point us in the wrong direction. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We happened upon a café and went directly in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As we mounted the staircase, we were greeted by an incredibly smiley waiter, Samad. Our stress melted away as he welcomed us in an upbeat tone, “Marhaba.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            We sat in that café for a while. Samad lit a fire and chatted with us. After a while, he pointed us in the right direction and invited us to come back anytime.</p>

        <p>
            This experience brought up an interesting question. When we are traveling, who do we trust? And why do we trust them? The answer is rooted in bias toward certain types of people. It has to do with appearance, age, the clothes they are wearing, and the apparent position they hold. We trusted smiley Samad instantly, but never once trusted someone on the street giving us directions. Later on, someone who noticed our lost faces did try to help us. When I ignored him, he asked me flat out “why don’t you trust me?” I couldn’t come up with a strong answer besides the fact that I had made a snap judgement of mistrust. If I really stop to analyze how I feel in situations of mistrust, I can begin to understand my own bias as a traveler. And we can all begin to understand the biases we hold as people.

        <h2>A Semi-Final</h2>
        <p>By Patrick Linehan</p>
        <p>
            Through the taxi window I could see people hanging off the back of pick-up trucks waving red flags and punching the air. Nouamane and Hassan talked rapidly to the driver, giddy with excitement. I was still waking up from my two-hour nap on the train<span id="dotstwo">...</span>
        </p>
        <div id="moretwo">
        <p>
            Nouamane, a friend who lives in Agadir, had convinced me a few weeks earlier that I should meet them at the Semi Final of the Throne Cup to cheer on Hassania Agadir against the team from Tétouan. So, I made the journey from Casablanca to Marrakech to see the game. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The taxi dropped us a short walk from the stadium entrance mobbed with young men decked out in their team colors. It was hard for me to tell which team they supported, because both teams wore red. Police were everywhere, armed with riot shields and batons, but the fans seemed calm and patient as they jostled to enter. One police officer was yanking people by the arm out of their cars as they tried to enter the parking lot. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A team of eight guards checked my bag, the first of three bag checks. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We entered through the designated Hassania entrance, and we found our seats two hours before the game was to start. People streamed in over those two hours, filling the entire southern side of the stadium. By the time the teams were done warming up, people were standing in the staircases and on the promenade. They opened up another section of seats to account for the overflow of people.  
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            When the teams were announced on the field, a loud popping echoed through the stadium, firecrackers. Bright red flares were ignited in the crowd, thrown onto the track surrounding the field, and calmly collected by firemen who stood ready. The three bag checks clearly didn’t work for everyone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Agadir “Ultras,” a large group of diehards that exist in every city in Morocco, unfurled a massive flag and raised a 40-foot-tall photo of one of their super fans. The scene was incredibly rehearsed and well organized. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the game started, I realized that Moroccan soccer is an entirely different sport. The ball is turned over so much more often and chances on net are so much more frequent than the BPL or MLS I am used to. The players are less technically skilled, and the field was a little worn, causing the ball to bobble off the ground a lot. It creates much excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hassania was awarded a penalty kick in the first 10 minuets. The first PK was blocked, but Hassania got another attempt after the virtual assistant referee caught the goalie jumping off the line before the ball was kicked. This was only the second soccer game in all of Africa to use VAR. The Tétouan goalie fought the ref so hard that he got a red card. Hassania scored on the second shot, and the rest of the game was played 10 v 11.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game ended 3-0. Nouamane and Hassan were pleased that their team would be moving to the final, and I was amazed at the passion and ritual surrounding the sport. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As we were leaving, we were directed to a specific exit so we wouldn’t clash with Tétouan fans. Hordes of police in full riot gear were positioned everywhere I looked. Nouamane joked that they were ready for war, but I did not see any conflict. As people poured onto the street, they sang songs and raised their hands, not to fight, but to celebrate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now Nouamane is trying to convince me to come to the final next Monday on the other side of the country. And it’s working.

        <h2>A Walk to Spain</h2>
        <p>By Patrick Linehan</p>
        <p>
            We cruised past a line of hundreds of Moroccan women in our 15-person van aptly marked “Tourisme” on its side. We passed the spot where just weeks ago a woman died falling into the ocean while waiting in this line. Seven women have died there since 2017<span id="dotsthree">...</span> 
        </p>
        <div id="morethree">
        <p>
            I hopped out of our van, United States Passport in hand, and joined a single file line of other study abroad students as we walked down the car lane against the flow of traffic. We did not stand with the other pedestrians who had been waiting for hours. Instead, we crossed from Morocco into Spain on foot in just minutes. No questions asked. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Ceuta, Spain is a continuation of the colonial era that has deeply engrained effects in Morocco and all of Africa. It is one of two Spanish enclaves in Morocco, the only two places where it is possible to walk from Africa to European Union-controlled land. But the E.U. has made it incredibly hard for people from Morocco and all of Africa to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            The women who wait in line in Morocco to buy and sell goods in Spain have the slim possibility of crossing. But thousands of migrants from elsewhere in Africa, mostly from south of the Sahara Desert, camp out for years in the hills surrounding the city, waiting to take the extremely dangerous chance to rush the border fence lined with armed guards and barbed wire to claim asylum in the E.U. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While we crossed unimpeded, our Moroccan Program Coordinator had to stay back. He had yet to receive the visa he applied for months earlier.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Once in Ceuta, the culture was completely Spanish. Everyone speaks Andalusian Spanish, drinks alcohol in open-air restaurants, and pays the check in Euros. The city center features opulent fountains and shopping promenades lined with European stores. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I had to continually remind myself that I had not gotten on a plane or a boat, and I was still in fact on the African continent. And at the top of the old fort at the spot where Spain’s fascist dictator, Franco, once stood claiming Ceuta for Spain decades earlier, the problem with this city became blatantly obvious. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From that spot I could see mainland Spain across the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. The Rock of Gibraltar, a United Kingdom territory, stood tall across the strait named after it, where 400 people die yearly trying to go to Europe on rickety boats. Morocco’s hills where migrants camp waiting to cross were to the east, and a line of cleared trees and tall fences marked where they could not go.
        </p>
        <p>
            I stood on that hill, completely shielded from this reality, feeling like shit.   
        </p>
        <p>
            The colonial powers, the United States included, robbed Africa. They robed its natural resources and took its people by force. They created the unrest that now causes people to flee their homes and travel thousands of miles to this border. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And those same colonial powers are the ones that are building taller walls and forcing Morocco to round up migrants and bus them hundreds of miles to the south to restart their journey from scratch. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet the streets of Ceuta feel wholly disconnected from the suffering happening on the other side of the fence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            People, including myself, sipped pricey sangria and munched on tapas under a perfectly blue Saturday sky. We spent a few hours there and walked back into Morocco at the day’s end, Zara bags and alcohol bottles in tow.
        </p>
        <p>
            For us it was a day trip to Spain. For those migrating from South of the Sahara, getting to that city which was stolen from their continent is a nearly impossible goal.
