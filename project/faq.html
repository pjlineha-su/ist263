        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>What is the best food in Morocco?</p>
        <h2>Answer</h2>
        <p>It depends! Morocco is known for its blend of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines. On Friday, you have to get couscous. Unlike American couscous, Moroccan couscous is light and fluffy. It can blow in the wind. It is usually served with meat like lamb or chicken and vegetables. Dive in with your hands or use a fork, the couscous is to die for and inexpensive.</p>

        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>Is Morocco safe?</p>
        <h2>Answer</h2>
        <p>Morocco is extremely safe. But like every place, there is crime. The best bet is to blend in as much as possible. Avoid revealing clothing or touristy accessories like cameras. Ask for directions from store owners or vendors, not random people on the street. They may ask you for money.</p>

        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>How are you supposed to eat? </p>
        <h2>Answer</h2>
        <p>The best way to eat in Morocco is with your hands. Every meal is served with plenty of bread, and Moroccans use the bread to scoop up the food on the plate. This is the most delicious way to enjoy tagine, another Moroccan staple.</p>

        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>Whatâ€™s the best city?</p>
        <h2>Answer</h2>
        <p>Every city has its own charm and reasons to fall in love with it. Marrakech and Tanger are the most visited cities, giving them a very international vibe. Rabat and Casablanca are cities that rely less on tourism, so they run like a true modern Morocco city. To the south, Agadir hosts some of the best surf spots in the world.</p>
